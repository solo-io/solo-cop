    "\n",
    "1. **Installing the Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs**  \n",
    "   The Gateway API is a standardized way to define how traffic enters your Kubernetes cluster. By installing its Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), you enable the foundation for advanced traffic management.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploying the Gloo Gateway CRDs**  \n",
    "  Gloo Gateway v2 extends the Gateway API with its own custom resources, adding powerful features like advanced routing, security policies, and observability. These CRDs are the building blocks for configuring Gloo Gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Installing Gloo Gateway v2 on your kind cluster**  \n",
    "   Finally, you will deploy the Gloo Gateway v2 controller and its components, bringing everything together into a fully operational API gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this important?**  \n",
    "This setup is the backbone of your Gloo Gateway v2 environment. It allows you to define, manage, and secure your API traffic in a Kubernetes-native way, making it easier to handle complex routing and security requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will install the Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs, deploy the Gloo Gateway v2 CRDs, and install Gloo Gateway v2 on the kind cluster."

    "#### 5. Configuring pod anti-affinity for Gloo Gateway proxies for high availability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to use **pod anti-affinity** rules to maximize the availability and resilience of your Gloo Gateway proxy deployment. Pod anti-affinity ensures that multiple instances of your gateway proxies are scheduled on different nodes or zones, reducing the risk of service disruption due to node or zone failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this configuration do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the `podTemplate.affinity.podAntiAffinity` field to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distribute gateway proxy pods across three different zones** (or nodes), ensuring that no two proxies run on the same zone or node.\n",
    "- **Prevent single points of failure** by making sure that a failure in one zone or node does not affect all your gateway proxies.\n",
    "- **Increase fault tolerance** and maintain service availability even during infrastructure outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is pod anti-affinity important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Availability**: By spreading pods across zones or nodes, you ensure that your API gateway remains available even if one zone or node goes down.\n",
    "- **Resilience**: Reduces the impact of hardware, network, or power failures in a single location.\n",
    "- **Best Practice for Production**: Distributing critical workloads is a standard approach for building robust, production-grade systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll achieve:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By configuring pod anti-affinity, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhance the reliability** of your Gloo Gateway deployment\n",
    "- **Minimize downtime** in the event of node or zone failures\n",
    "- **Meet high availability requirements** for mission-critical applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your Kubernetes cluster spans three availability zones, pod anti-affinity ensures that each Gloo Gateway proxy pod is scheduled in a different zone. This way, even if an entire zone becomes unavailable, your API gateway continues to operate in the remaining zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will deploy three Gloo Gateway proxies in your Kubernetes clusters and they are spread across all three different zones in the `us-east-1` region using the `podTemplate.affinity.nodeAffinity` rules."
