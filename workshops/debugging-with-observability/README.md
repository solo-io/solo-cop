# Debugging With Observability

This workshop is split into 3 labs.

- [Lab 1: Full Observability](./1-gloo-platform-observability/README.md). For application deployed within Gloo Platform.
  The workshop will collect Traces, Logs and Metrics from the applications.
- [Lab 2: Test In Production](./2-test-in-production/README.md). Re-using the application from previous lab, we will
  inject faults and test the application in production.
- [Lab 3: Debugging in Production](./3-debug-in-production). After finding a misbehavior in the application,
  we will use the collected data to debug the issue in the production environment itself.
